# Fast Image Encryption Algorithm based on Parallel Computing System

This repo implements an image encryption algorithm including the permutation and diffusion steps for a parallel architecture, as well as the decryption algorithm based on [1], and an existing implementation [2].

To run the program, install the requirements and run the module with
`python -m src.main <show_images_flag> <file_name>`
where `<show_images_flag> == 1` will show the original, permuted, diffused, and decrypted images, and `<file_name>` is the name of the file in the `img` directory (defaults to `landscape_1.png`).
